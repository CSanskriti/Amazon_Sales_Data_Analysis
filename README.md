# Amazon India Sales Dataset Analysis
## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to increase revenue and improve the performance of product categories on Amazon India. We aim to achieve this by calculating the percentage of revenue for the top 3 product categories and setting a target to increase the percentage of revenue for the lowest of the top 3 categories by 5% by the end of Q3 2022. This strategy will help reduce dependence on a single product category, resulting in a more balanced revenue distribution.

## Preliminary Analysis
Based on the analysis of Q2 2022 performance data for Amazon India, we have observed the following key insights:

Revenue Decline: The total revenue for Q2 2022 exhibited a significant decrease of -18.77% from April to June. May revenue experienced a -9.06% decline from April, and June revenue saw a -10.68% decline from May. This decline in revenue over the quarter is a cause for concern and requires attention.

Dominant Product Categories: The revenue is primarily dominated by the product category "Set," accounting for 49.88% of the total revenue. It is followed by "Kurta" with 27.09% and "Western Dress" with 14.28%. These categories are significant revenue contributors.

High-Value Orders: The top 5 product categories by average price in dollars are "Set" ($9.43), "Saree" ($9.14), "Western Dress" ($8.75), "Ethnic Dress" ($8.26), and "Top" ($6.09). This indicates that these products are associated with high-value orders, offering potential for increased revenue.

Order Cancellations and Returns: A total of 49,178 orders were cancelled or returned, representing 17.53% of all orders. Among these, 14.22% were cancelled orders, and 1.64% were returned orders. Analyzing the reasons for cancellations and returns can help improve customer satisfaction.

Customer Type Analysis: The average order amount varies by customer type, with business customers having an average order value of $8.21, while regular customers have an average order value of $7.37. Understanding these differences can aid in tailoring marketing strategies.

Regional Trends: The most popular product category varies by state. It is essential to analyze the reasons behind these regional trends and consider targeted marketing campaigns or promotions to capitalize on regional preferences.

## Analysis Summary and Recommendations
Based on the preliminary analysis, we recommend the following strategies to boost revenue and enhance product category performance:

Promotions for Western Dress: Implement promotions targeting the "Western Dress" category to increase its revenue. Focus on the top 50% of states ranked by sales revenue, as their revenue potential is between 10 and 100 times more than the top-ranked states in the lower 50%. This targeted approach will maximize the impact of promotions.

## Implementation and Analysis of Strategies: Work closely with the client to implement promotions for the "Western Dress" category.

Monitor the Impact: Continuously monitor and track the sales revenue for the "Western Dress" category after the promotions are implemented. This will help assess the immediate impact and make necessary adjustments.

Analyze the Effectiveness: Conduct a comprehensive analysis after the promotions have been running for some time to evaluate their effectiveness. Determine whether the 5% increase target for the lowest of the top 3 categories is achieved.

By following these recommendations and closely monitoring the impact, Amazon India can work towards achieving its revenue growth and category performance improvement goals.
